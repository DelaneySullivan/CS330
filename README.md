How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The most new useful design skill that helped me craft my project was really learning the ins and outs of OpenGL. By this, I mean doing extensive outside research to fully understand the materal. Although time consuming, it helped me get through each project with some ease. A design process I followed for my project was to preplan my work. What I would do before each assignment is draw out how I'd want the program to operate. For example - for the lighting assignment I mapped out where each light should hit so that I didn't have to stress over it when programming. I think using this tactic in future work would be extremely helpful - as it cuts down time and mistakes within a project.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

As I said before - I am a visual learner so drawing/mapping out how my program will run is very important to my design process. Whether it is a UML, drawing of a 3D object etc. It all helps in one way or another! A new development strategy I learned while working on my 3D scene was that I was not aware that triangles were heavily used to make all the shapes. This was interesting to learn. Iteration factored into my development heavily as I used it to create multiple objects. For example, multiple cube lights displayed throughout the scene. I feel that my knowledge grew throughout each milestone - this allowed me to evolve my skills in OpenGL to continue through each assignment. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer Science has helped me reach my goals by giving me the ability to logically work out problems, solve complex issues, and create programs to help others. I am not 100% that computational graphics and visualizations has given me advanced knowledge/skills that could be applied to my future educational/professional pathway. I do not see myself using this type of education in the future, it is geared more towards game development which I am not persuing. Regardless - it was a fun class to take. I enjoyed challenging myself and really going above and beyond from where I first started with this course.
